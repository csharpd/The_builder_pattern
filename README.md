<h1>The Design Pattern</h1>

Design patterns are the common idioms of code. They are like little spring-loaded
solutions to common programming problems.When the appropriate problem
comes along, you should trigger the design pattern to solve your problem. 

It's useful to be able to recognise the common problems that arise repeatedly when you are building software. 

"The advantage of design patterns is that they let you rapidly wing your way past the problems that someone has already solves, so that you can get on to the hard stuff, the code that is unique to your situation."
